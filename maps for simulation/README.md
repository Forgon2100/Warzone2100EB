10c-EB-SampleNoMod.wz is used for simulating a perfect research game. Use T1 half-base settings with infinite power enabled
10c-AAAAAAAAAAAA is the same map but without the extra research centers

These maps are used for general purpose testing. AAAAAAA appears on the first tab near the beginning :)

TIP:
Simulating perfect research game verifies arrival times of research items relative to others. 

Testing weapon balance only makes sense under perfect research conditions otherwise the results would be biased by the weapon upgrades.
